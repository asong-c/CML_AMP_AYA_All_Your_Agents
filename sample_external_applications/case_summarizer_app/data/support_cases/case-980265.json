A print of all the env vars in a user session\n\n You also mentioned that this is affecting newly created projects, does this also affect older projects?"

Since this is a new team, can you check if these users have some of these same ENVs set in their user settings?\n\nIf they do, User ENVs take precendence. The order of precendence is Workspace ENVs, Project ENVs, User ENVs. Here is a link to the product documentation that describes this in more detail"

Looks like our onboarding steps for these new users indicated that these ENV vars should be set and users were setting it in their own User settings which would break any project settings we were trying to maintain. We've gotten the team to remove their misconfigured settings and now everything is working normally.\n\nOne of our admins suggested that we can set some ENV vars at the Project or Workspace level that cannot be ser by Users in their own settings. Can you rais a feature request for that?"
